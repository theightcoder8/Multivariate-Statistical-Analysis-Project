# Multivariate Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a project on multivariate statistical analysis, covering various topics such as eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations, data matrix analysis, Mahalanobis distance, canonical correlation analysis, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, and correspondence analysis. The project includes theoretical concepts and practical implementations using Excel.

## Contents
- **Excel Calculations**: Calculation of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, covariance matrices, correlation matrices, Mahalanobis distance, and various other multivariate statistical measures in Excel.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Analysis of data matrices, including sum of squares and cross-products (SSCP), and interpretation of results using Excel.
- **MANOVA**: Application of one-way and two-way repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for independent groups.
- **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**.
- **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**.
- **Logistic Regression Analysis**: Implementation and interpretation in Excel.
- **Discriminant Analysis**: Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Analysis of clustering techniques and applications.
- **Correspondence Analysis**: Understanding and implementation.
