# Multivariate Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a project on multivariate statistical analysis, covering various topics such as eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations, data matrix analysis, Mahalanobis distance, canonical correlation analysis, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, and correspondence analysis. The project includes theoretical concepts and practical implementations using Excel.

## Contents
- **Excel Calculations**: Calculation of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, covariance matrices, correlation matrices, Mahalanobis distance, and various other multivariate statistical measures in Excel.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Analysis of data matrices, including sum of squares and cross-products (SSCP), and interpretation of results using Excel.
- **MANOVA**: Application of one-way and two-way repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for independent groups.
- **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**: Theoretical concepts and implementation in Excel.
- **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**: Drive 11 - 12th weeks.
- **Logistic Regression Analysis**: Implementation and interpretation in Excel (10th week).
- **Discriminant Analysis**: Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis (Drive 8-9th weeks).
- **Cluster Analysis**: Analysis of clustering techniques and applications (Drive 7th week).
- **Correspondence Analysis**: Understanding and implementation (6th week).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Excel files (.xlsx) containing the calculations and analyses.
3. Follow the instructions provided in each Excel file to understand the calculations and interpretations.
4. Refer to the README files within each folder for detailed explanations of the concepts and methodologies used.
